Hi!

I'm studying to become a .NET Web Developer at EC Utbildning and this is my second school assignment.
The main task was to create reusable components in React that would be used on several different pages on the website. I was given a design file in Figma that I was supposed to create a website from.

Some topics covered in this assignment:

-The website is created in React + White.
-Use of components.
-Use of React Hooks.
-Send/retrieve data to and from a web api.
-Validate forms and handle error messages.
-Version control the code with Git and GitHUB.
-Accessibility according to WCAG 2.1 as far as possible.

This assignment did not require me to build the website for mobile and tablet (Although this is something you should always do), therefore I have only built the website 
for "Desktop" (1920x1080). This is because in this case I focused on learning React etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE! 

-When I built this website, I used React Router that I downloaded.
-To see what changes I have made to try to meet the requirements of WCAG 2.1 - see notes in each component and section.

In some parts of this project I have used CHATGPT. Either for a code block, a line of code or as a debugging aid to be able to structure the code correctly. Comments about 
this can be found in the project files.

Hope you like the end result!
